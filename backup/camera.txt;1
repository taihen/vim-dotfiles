Problem description:

    After start camera freezes every 10-20 seconds for the same amount of time and then resumes.
    With time ( hour is enough ) camera freezes more often till it pauses completely and the only thing to do is to power it off and on again.
    At the time that it's frozen you can not access web interface and ping is timing out as well.
